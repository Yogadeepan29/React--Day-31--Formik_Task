<p align='center'>A web-based library management system built with React, Formik, and Yup.</p>

**Overview**

This project is a web-based library management system that allows users to manage authors and books. The system provides features to create, edit, and delete author and book records, and validates form inputs using Formik and Yup. The system also uses Bootstrap for responsive design and provides navigation using Navbar, Sidebar, and Footer components.

**Features**
------------

* Manage authors and books
* Create, edit, and delete author and book records
* Validate form inputs using Formik and Yup
* Responsive design using Bootstrap
* Navigation using responsive Sidebar component

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yogadeepan29/React--Day-31--Formik_Task.git `
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to the dashboard to view author and book records
3. Click on "Create New Author" or "Create New Book" to add new records

**Technologies**
--------------

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* Formik: A JavaScript library for managing form state and validation
* Yup: A JavaScript library for schema validation
* Bootstrap: A CSS framework for responsive design

**What I Learned**
-----------------

* Formik: I learned how to use Formik to manage form state and validation in React applications.
* Yup: I learned how to use Yup to define schema validation rules for form inputs.

**Challenges and Takeaways**
---------------------------

* One of the biggest challenges I faced was implementing form validation using Formik and Yup. However, I learned that by breaking down the problem into smaller components and focusing on each step of the validation process, I was able to overcome this challenge.
* Another takeaway from this project is the importance of responsive design. By using Bootstrap, I was able to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
